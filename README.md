# 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap

## Introduction

For this project I have to implement a design from scratch using all that we learned from previous projects. 

## Task Overview
In this project, you will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.



## Project
We weren't given a lot of instructions and are free to implement it the way we want. The objective is to have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the design files given to us.

## Requirements
- You have to use Bootstrap

- your styles.css must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes

## Motivation
Learning a framework like Bootstrap has been fun and exciting. Especially when trying to get your website to be responsive and mobile first. Bootstrap makes development so much easier when it comes to designing a mobile first experience. I also have an interest in UI/UX and learning how to work with designers is crucial to delivering on a project.
